= CrossConnector

CrossConnector is a web-based collaboration program, originally designed for ministries and missionaries. 

 * CrossConnector lets you keep all your ministry information in one place. 
 * It's an easy way to publish your ministry information on the web. 
 * Use CrossConnector to plan a single mission trip or all your church's ministry information.

This is pretty old code! Please give me a lot of grace when you're reading the sources. 

Please feel free to branch, fork, push, pull, and use this code for your own purposes (only for good, not for evil). All I ask is that you give me credit for the idea and retain the license agreement (see LICENSE file) with my copyright info. 

== Support

Unfortunately, I cannot provide support for this software. It's basic Ruby on Rails, so you should be able to get it running pretty easily. Other than that, you're on your own.
